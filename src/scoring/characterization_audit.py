"""``CharacterizationAuditor`` — audit the final biosphere against the method CF rows.

This checks coverage, not factor correctness. It never invents a factor or resolves
unqualified methane. The core-gas policy covers CO2, CH4 and N2O emitted to air; for
every other flow the receipt gives each method's counts, for method-specific review.
The receipt holds counts and the named core gases, never the list of flow ids: most
emitted flows have no factor in most methods (about 4,150 of 4,260 per method on the
AGRIBALYSE 3.2 build). For an emitted package that list can be rebuilt from its
``ids.json`` and characterization matrices; a withheld candidate has no package, and
its receipt names the gases that withheld it.

``status`` is ``passed`` only if at least one headline climate method (a method key
with the part "climate change") was audited and nothing failed; ``not_audited`` if
the registry holds no such method, so that a pass never means "nothing to check".

A core gas that scores zero fails the audit, whether it has no factor row or a row that
says 0, with one exception that the method itself must prove: a species the method
defines as exactly zero. EF 3.1 lists biogenic CO2 emissions to air with a factor of 0,
but under its own flow ids; the ecoinvent biosphere flow "Carbon dioxide, non-fossil"
that the inventory emits has no row of its own. Such a flow is reported as zero by
method definition, apart from a missing factor, and only while the method's CF table
carries those explicit zero rows.
