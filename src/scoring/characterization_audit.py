"""``CharacterizationAuditor`` — audit the final biosphere against the method CF rows.

This checks coverage, not factor correctness. It never invents a factor or resolves
unqualified methane. The core-gas policy covers CO2, CH4 and N2O emitted to air; for
every other flow the receipt gives each method's counts, for method-specific review.
The receipt holds counts and the named core gases, never the list of flow ids: most
emitted flows have no factor in most methods (about 4,150 of 4,260 per method on the
AGRIBALYSE 3.2 build), and that list can be rebuilt from the package's ``ids.json``
and characterization matrices.

A core gas without a factor row fails the audit, with one exception that the method
itself must prove: a species the method defines as exactly zero. EF 3.1 lists biogenic
CO2 emissions to air with a factor of 0, but under its own flow ids; the ecoinvent
biosphere flow "Carbon dioxide, non-fossil" that the inventory emits has no row of its
own. Such a flow is reported as zero by method definition, apart from a missing factor,
and only while the method's CF table carries those explicit zero rows.
